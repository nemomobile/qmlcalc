- adaptive text size based on number of digits, similar to Harmattan
  (doable by a second Text, visible: false, check paintedWidth until it fits)
- key bindings for hardware keyboards
- showing active operation when inserting second operand, if possible?
- make equals button look exciting when it can be used
- settings/'advanced mode' somehow? needs to be very non-intrusive into the UI,
  maybe approach with different layouts, switchable using a swipe?
- change .desktop to use single instance mode somehow
- less crappy exit button (also: make it a minimise button)
